Whispers in the breeze
Petals fall without a sound
Spring bows to the sun

I walked alone through the night,
not seeking stars,
but silence.
And in the hush between the wind,
I found something like peaceâ€”
shaped like a memory I forgot to miss.

The moonlight danced on silver seas,
And brushed the tops of twilight trees.
It whispered tales from days gone by,
Then vanished in the morning sky
